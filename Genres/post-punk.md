Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-punk):
Post-punk (originally called new musick) is a broad genre of [[rock]] music that emerged in the late 1970s in the wake of [[punk]] rock. Post-punk musicians departed from punk's traditional elements and raw simplicity, instead adopting a broader, more experimental approach that encompassed a variety of avant-garde sensibilities and non-rock influences. Inspired by [[punk]]'s energy and do it yourself ethic but determined to break from rock cliches, artists experimented with styles like [[funk]], [[electronic music]], [[jazz]], and [[dance music]]; the production techniques of [[dub]] and [[disco]]; and ideas from art and politics, including [[critical theory]], [[modernist art]], cinema and literature. These communities produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and [[fanzines]].

The early post-punk vanguard was represented by groups including [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Wire]], [[Public Image Ltd]], [[the Pop Group]], [[Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Magazine]], [[Pere Ubu]], [[Joy Division]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Devo]], [[Gang of Four]], [[the Slits]], [[the Cure]], and [[the Fall]]. The movement was closely related to the development of ancillary genres such as [[gothic rock]], [[neo-psychedelia]], [[no wave]], and [[industrial]] music. By the mid-1980s, post-punk had dissipated, but it provided a foundation for the [[New Pop]] movement and the later alternative and independent genres.
