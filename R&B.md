#genre 

Contemporary R&B (or simply R&B) is a popular music genre that combines rhythm and [[blues]] with elements of [[pop]], [[soul]], [[funk]],[[ hip hop]], and [[electronic music]].

The genre features a distinctive record production style and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend and the use of hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R&B vocalists often use melisma, and since the mid-1980s, R&B rhythms have been combined with elements of hip hop culture and music and pop culture and pop music.
