Mau5trap (stylized as mau5trap; pronounced "mousetrap") is a Canadian [[independent record label]] founded in 2007 by electronic music producer [[Deadmau5]]. The label was formerly a vanity label, hosting releases through labels such as [[Ultra Music]], [[Virgin Records]], and [[Astralwerks]].

The label's first release was Zimmerman's "Faxing Berlin", also released by [[Play Records]] and [[Cinnamon Flava]]. The second artist on the label was Canadian DJ [[Glenn Morrison]], which Zimmerman later revealed to have ghost produced for. In 2008, after more artists were signed to moderate success, Mau5trap partnered with [[Ultra Records]] and released Zimmerman's third studio album, [[Random Album Title (2008)]] to commercial success.

In 2010, Mau5trap signed American producer [[Skrillex]], and released his second EP [[Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites]] in partnership with [[Big Beat Records]].[4][5]

In 2012, Mau5trap signed English hip hop group [[Foreign Beggars]] and released their third studio album [[The Uprising]], [[Moguai]] released his second studio album Mpire, [[Noisia]] released a special edition of Split the Atom, and Mau5trap debuted the compilation series We Are Friends.[6]

In 2013, following Zimmerman's departure from Ultra Records, Mau5trap ended their partnership with the former partner label.[7] In June 2013, Mau5trap briefly partnered with [[Astralwerks]], a subsidiary of [[Universal Music Group]]. In 2015, Mau5trap became a fully [[independent record label]] with music rights and publishing managed through [[Kobalt Music Group]].[8]

In 2016, Zimmerman's eighth studio album, [[W:/2016ALBUM/]], became Mau5trap's first fully independent album release.[9] In 2017, Mau5trap also independently released the debut studio album by Canadian music producer [[Rezz]], titled [[Mass Manipulation]].[10]

In 2017, Mau5trap celebrated its tenth anniversary, and released a thirty-threeâ€“track compilation album titled Mau5trap Ten Year Anniversary.
