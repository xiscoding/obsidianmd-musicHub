Killing Joke are an English rock band from Notting Hill, London, England, formed in 1979 by [[Jaz Coleman]] (vocals, keyboards), [[Paul Ferguson]] (drums), [[Geordie Walker]] (guitar) and [[Youth]] (bass).

musical style emerged from the [[post-punk]] scene, but stood out due to their heavier approach, and has been cited as a key influence on [[industrial]] rock.
Their style evolved over many years, at times incorporating elements of [[gothic rock]], [[synth-pop]] and [[electronic music]], often bearing Walker's prominent guitar and Coleman's "savagely strident vocals".

The band was formed in June 1979. Coleman said their manifesto at the time was to "define the exquisite beauty of the atomic age in terms of style, sound and form".


Killing Joke have influenced numerous bands such as [[Nirvana]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[My Bloody Valentine]], [[Faith No More]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Tool]], [[Godflesh]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Metallica]] and [[Marilyn Manson]]. 

[[James Hetfield]] picked Coleman as one of his favourite singers.
