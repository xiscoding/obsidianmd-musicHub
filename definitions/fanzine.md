A fanzine (blend of fan and magazine or -zine) is a non-professional and non-official publication produced by enthusiasts of a particular cultural phenomenon (such as a literary or musical genre) for the pleasure of others who share their interest. The term was coined in an October 1940 science fiction fanzine by [[Russ Chauvenet]] and first popularized within science fiction fandom, and from there the term was adopted by other communities.

By the mid-1960s, several fans active in science fiction and comics fandom recognized a shared interest in rock music, and the rock fanzine was born. [[Paul Williams]] and [[Greg Shaw]] were two such SF-fans turned rock zine editors. Williams' Crawdaddy! (1966) and Shaw's two California-based zines, Mojo Navigator (full title, "Mojo-Navigator Rock and Roll News") (1966) and Who Put the Bomp, (1970), are among the most important early [[rock]] fanzines.

Crawdaddy! (1966) quickly moved from its fanzine roots to become one of the first rock music "prozines", with paid advertisers and newsstand distribution. Bomp remained a fanzine, featuring many writers who would later become prominent [[music journalist]]s, including [[Lester Bangs]], [[Greil Marcus]], [[Ken Barnes]], [[Ed Ward]], [[Dave Marsh]], [[Mike Saunders]] and [[R. Meltzer]]. 

Other rock fanzines of this period include denim delinquent 1971, edited by Jymn Parrett, Flash, 1972, edited by Mark Shipper, Eurock Magazine (1973â€“1993) edited by Archie Patterson and Bam Balam, written and published by Brian Hogg in East Lothian, Scotland, beginning in 1974, and in the mid-1970s, Back Door Man.

In the [[post-punk era]], several well-written fanzines emerged that cast an almost academic look at earlier, neglected musical forms, including [[Mike Stax' Ugly Things]], [[Billy Miller and Miriam Linna's Kicks]], [[Jake Austen's Roctober]], [[Kim Cooper's Scram]], [[P. Edwin Letcher's Garage & Beat]], and the [[UK's Shindig!]] and [[Italy's Misty Lane]].
