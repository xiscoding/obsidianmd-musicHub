Get Scraped is the debut studio album by Canadian [[electronic music]] producer Deadmau5, released on July 26, 2005, by the independent record label Zoolook.

The album has a 2005 [[demo CD]] release, which Zimmerman claimed to have been limited to "about 100 copies". Several copies of the demo have since been rediscovered by fans. A revised digital download was released on June 12, 2006. Two tracks "FlashTV" and "Messages from Nowhere" were omitted from the digital release. However they were digitally re-released in 2006 by Nicholas Da Silva, the owner of [[Zoolook Records]] on his since removed album [[Hitless]]. In March 2017, Zimmerman himself re-released "Messages from Nowhere" on his compilation album Stuff I Used to Do, which also included the tracks "Sometimes I Fail", "Support", "Try Again" and "Unspecial Effects" from the album as well.

In 2018, the digital download version of Get Scraped was removed from all major streaming and digital download services for unknown reasons, making the album unavailable to listen to in full.
