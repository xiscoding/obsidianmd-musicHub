Classic jazz-funk fusion from the late, great Japanese guitarist [[Ryo Kawasaki]]. Recorded in New York, and originally released in 1976, 'Juice' presents Ryo at the height of his powers.

Juice' has become a much-loved album for crate diggers and jazz-funk enthusiasts, with its tracks frequently being sampled and re-imagined in hip-hop. The smokey, beat-down, spiritual funk jam [['Bamboo Child']] has been flipped by [[Diamond D]], [[Puff Daddy]], and [[Kool G Rap]]. The album was released in 1976 on [[RCA Records]] and features the musicians' drummer [[Jimmy Young]], rhythm guitarist [[Hugh McCracken]], and bassist [[Stu Woods]] amongst other luminaries. A solid album throughout that incorporates a heavy dose of tripped-out synths alongside the emerging disco sound of the time. Tracks such as the opener ‘Raisins’, with its drum beat intro and bubbling bass-line, rivals The Headhunters at their finest. A superb album from an underground legend.
