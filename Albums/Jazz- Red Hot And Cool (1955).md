Recorded during three different stays at New York's Basin Street, Jazz: Red, Hot and Cool is making its first appearance in the U.S. on CD. It documents -- with the addition of two additional performances that were previously unissued -- the original Brubeck quartet in its final years. In 1956 [[Joe Morello]] would replace [[Joe Dodge]], and in 1958 [[Eugene Wright]] would take over the bass chair from [[Bob Bates]]. What strikes the listener about this band, is a having been seasoned for five years when the first of these performances were recorded, the Brubeck quartet was far more immersed in the blues than anyone -- at least the critics of the time -- had given them credit for. [[Paul Desmond]]'s alto tone had yet to take on the dry martini velvety texture that became his trademark, and Brubeck was not yet inserting the totality of his classical ideas about the extrapolation of dissonance from consonance and its resulting harmonic theory that was built on an elaborate contrapuntal system. These ideas, that were introduced to him by the French composer and instructor [[Darius Milhaud]] and the music of [[Shostakovich]] and [[Stravinsky]] would later result in the wildly inventive tonal identity expressed in his compositions on Jazz Impressions of [[Eurasia]], [[Jazz Impressions of New York]], and even [[Time Out (1959)]].
