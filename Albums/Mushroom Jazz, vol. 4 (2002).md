Mushroom Jazz is a series of musical compilations by DJ [[Mark Farina]]. Originating in 1992 these were released on cassette tape, then since 1996 have been commercial CD and vinyl releases. Farina combines elements of downtempo, [[hip hop]], [[jazz]] and [[R&B]], French, Latin, beatmatching and mixing songs together. As with Farina's [[house music]] mixes, the Mushroom Jazz series incorporates transitional effects (such as a high-pass filter) and a generally dry reverb tone.
