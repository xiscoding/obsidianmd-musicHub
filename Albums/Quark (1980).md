-Quark released in 1980 is an avant-garde, [[jazz fusion]] album with splashes of [[prog]] and [[ambient]]. Each track is a 10+ minute long epic that takes you on a journey through oscillating textures and sounds.
-Minimal track “Insight” brings to mind sci-fi film 2001: A Space Odyssey. A slow pulsating beat guides you past splashes of glittering electronic garble and shimmering synths. Till reaching an end where all that’s left is that heartbeat fading to nothingness.
-It’s clear the album was set up to be listened through in a single sitting as Fukamachi’s prior movie experience allowed him to masterfully create cinematic themes spanning across the tracks. In terms of samples, there’s definitely usable synth sounds for beatmakers considering how rich the created textures are
