Ryo Kawasaki (川崎 燎, Kawasaki Ryō, February 25, 1947 – April 13, 2020) was a Japanese [[jazz fusion]] [[guitarist]], [[composer]] and band leader, best known as one of the first musicians to develop and popularise the fusion genre and for helping to develop the guitar synthesizer in collaboration with [[Roland Corporation]] and [[Korg]]. His album [[Ryo Kawasaki and the Golden Dragon Live]] was one of the first all-digital recordings and he created the [[Kawasaki Synthesizer ]]for the [[Commodore 64]]. During the 1960s, he played with various Japanese jazz groups and also formed his own bands. In the early 1970s, he moved to New York City, where he settled and worked with [[Gil Evans]], [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]], [[Ted Curson]], [[Joanne Brackeen]] amongst others. In the mid-1980s, Kawasaki drifted out of performing music in favour of writing music software for computers. He also produced several [[techno]] dance singles, formed his own record company called [[Satellites Records]], and later returned to jazz-fusion in 1991

Born in Japan in 1947, Ryo had a long and stellar career recording and releasing music up until his passing on 13 April 2020, in Tallinn, Estonia. Ryo is one of the pioneers of the [[jazz fusion]] genre, with the Japanese jazz fusion / funk sound becoming extremely influential within the 80s UK club scene and amongst its DJs. His track [['Trinkets & Things']] became a bonafide underground classic. In the US he worked with some of the greats of jazz, such as [[Elvin Jones]], [[Chico Hamilton]] and [[Bobbi Humphrey]], to name but a few. A forward-thinking and ever-evolving musician, Ryo collaborated with the Roland Corporation and Korg on the 'guitar synthesizer' and later wrote music software for computers. Later in life he relocated to Estonia and worked there, as well as Finland, Sweden, and the Baltic states.
