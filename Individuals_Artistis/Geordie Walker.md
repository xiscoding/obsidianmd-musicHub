When he was eight years old, Walker was deeply marked by the guitar's sound in the song "Sabre Dance" by [[Love Sculpture]]. "I used to go mad when it came on the radio."
Once played the solo on [[The Carpenter’s]] song “I’ll say goodbye to love” with a small group in a school concert.

Walker later moved to London to study architecture and became a founding member of Killing Joke in 1979 when he responded to an advertisement placed by the singer Jaz Coleman. He had never played in a band before.

Walker's tuning of guitar is different. He likes it to be strung a whole tone lower. "It suits the resonance and the volume of the thing, and you can use heavier strings. I’ve got 58s on the bottom. Basically if I play an E-position chord, it’s D

His preferred guitar of choice is a hollow-bodied 1952 [[Gibson ES-295]] in gold lacquer:[3] an instrument also previously used by [[Elvis Presley]] sideman [[Scotty Moore]]. It is a [[semi-acoustic guitar]], made in 1952, with a [[trapeze tailpiece]]. Walker bought it from an old jazzman who played in clubs. He plugged it into the Burman amplifier, "and the sound was there – a full resonance, and totally bell-like with the sustain on it through 250 watts of amplification in stereo. You can feel the thing vibrating, it's a huge sound. I tune the guitar in D (below bottom E) and my strings are really thick, I use an 062 on the bottom, and because of the way I tune the guitar, the strings still have the same response as a normal guitar would. The amplification makes the bottom end sound unreal. [...] the sound of the guitar is a lot sharper, a lot clearer than other ones I've heard."
