Martin Glover was born on 27 December 1960 in Slough, at that point part of Buckinghamshire, England.
He attended Kingham Hill School, an independent private school in Oxfordshire, where he met Alex Paterson, who would become a roadie for Glover's band Killing Joke, and later founder of [[The Orb]]. 
Naming himself Youth after the roots reggae chanter [[Big Youth]], in 1977 he joined [[punk]] rock band [[the Rage]], who toured with [[the Adverts]]. Later he joined "4 Be 2", a band formed by [[John Lydon's]] brother Jimmy Lydon, and recorded the "One of the Lads" single with them.

Youth was the bass player in Killing Joke but left the band in 1982 and soon after founded his own commercially-orientated dub [[reggae-funk fusion]] band [[Brilliant]] with future [[The KLF]] member [[Jimmy Cauty]]. The act recorded one album with producers [[Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW)]] in 1985 before disbanding.

In 2008, Youth produced the [[Delays]] album [[Everything's the Rush]], [[the Futureheads']] [[This Is Not The World]] and worked on the debut album of American band [[The Daylights]]. In 2013, Glover produced the debut album [[Collective]] by the DIY indie rock band [[Echotape]], followed by [[Meteorites]] by [[Echo and the Bunnymen]] and [[Lion]] by [[Peter Murphy]]. The following year, Glover produced [[Culture Club]]'s Tribes album.
