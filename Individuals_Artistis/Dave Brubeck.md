David Warren Brubeck (/ˈbruːbɛk/; December 6, 1920 – December 5, 2012) was an American [[jazz]] pianist and composer. Often regarded as a foremost exponent of [[cool jazz]], Brubeck's work is characterized by unusual time signatures and superimposing contrasting rhythms, meters, and tonalities.

[[Time Out (1959)]] became Brubeck's highest-selling album, and the first jazz album to sell over one million copies. The lead single from the album, "[[Take Five]]", a tune written by Desmond in 5
4 time, similarly became the highest-selling jazz single of all time.

In 1951, Brubeck organized [[The Dave Brubeck Quartet]], with [[Paul Desmond]] on alto saxophone. The two took up residency at San Francisco's Black Hawk nightclub and had success touring college campuses, recording a series of live albums.

The first of these live albums, [[Jazz at Oberlin]], was recorded in March 1953 in the Finney Chapel at Oberlin College. Brubeck's live performance was credited with legitimizing the field of jazz music at Oberlin, and the album is one of the earliest examples of cool jazz. Brubeck returned to College of the Pacific to record [[Jazz at the College of the Pacific]] in December of that year.

Following the release of Jazz at the College of the Pacific, Brubeck signed with [[Fantasy Records]], believing that he had a stake in the company and worked as an artists and repertoire promoter for the label, encouraging the Weiss brothers to sign other contemporary jazz performers, including [[Gerry Mulligan]], [[Chet Baker]] and [[Red Norvo]]. Upon discovering that the deal was for a half interest in his own recordings, Brubeck quit to sign with another label, [[Columbia Records]].
