Clarence Williamson, November 1961, London, England. In 1973, Williamson went to Jamaica with his family where he completed his schooling and played guitar. During his six years in Jamaica he entered and won many local talent competitions where his voice was often compared to that of [[Gregory Isaacs]]. His career took off in 1980 when he returned to the UK with his family. He linked up with Time Records for his debut release, ‘Bristol Riot’ aka ‘I’ve Got To Go’, a prophetic comment relating to the inner-city disturbances in the UK. He consolidated his position with ‘Chant In A Dance’, which was his last with Time. He initially performed as a singer but discovered he could perform equally as well as a DJ. In 1981 he released ‘Rat Cut A Bottle’, which became an anthem in the roots market. In 1982, he appeared at the 5th Black Echoes Annual Reggae Awards, headlined by Michigan And Smiley, alongside [[Ranking Dread]] and [[Carroll Thompson]], where his performance was critically acclaimed. The show was followed by a tour of the Netherlands, returning to the UK where he continued to promote his work. In late 1996 ‘Rat Cut A Bottle’ was re-released, generating considerable interest in his back catalog.
